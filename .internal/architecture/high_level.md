# Project Summary

## Overview
This project integrates Cucumber, Langchain, Qdrant, and MongoDB to automate feature file generation and manage testing workflows. It includes a Streamlit frontend for uploads, FastAPI for backend operations, and employs Pydantic for data validation.

## Architecture Components

### Streamlit Frontend
- **Purpose**: Provides a user interface for document upload and results display.
- **Components**:
  - `streamlit_app.py`: Main application script for user interactions.

### FastAPI Backend with Pydantic Validation
- **Purpose**: Serves as the backend API, handling requests and data processing.
- **Features**:
  - Pydantic models ensure data integrity and validation.
  - Orchestrates the flow between services.

### Input Processing Service with Pydantic
- **Purpose**: Parses and summarizes user stories and scenarios.
- **Key Components**:
  - Pydantic models (`UserStory`, `Scenario`) for structured data handling.
  - Validation mechanisms to maintain data quality.

### Feature File Generation Service
- **Purpose**: Utilizes Langchain to generate Gherkin-syntax feature files.
- **Functionality**:
  - Integrates with LLM for dynamic content generation.
  - Validates output through Pydantic models.

### Code Analysis and Abstraction Module
- **Purpose**: Analyzes feature files for patterns and possible abstraction.
- **Implementation**:
  - Code analysis tools to detect and suggest refactoring opportunities.

### Test Automation Integration
- **Purpose**: Processes feature files with Cypress and the Cucumber preprocessor.
- **Details**:
  - Node.js integration for Cypress testing.
  - Pydantic models manage test configurations and validations.

### Vectorization and Qdrant Service
- **Purpose**: Handles vectorization of texts and interactions with the Qdrant database.
- **Description**:
  - Manages the uploading and querying of vector data for similarity checks.

### Metadata Management and MongoDB with Pydantic
- **Purpose**: Stores and manages test metadata and artifact URLs.
- **Functionality**:
  - MongoDB collections powered by Pydantic models for consistency.

### Unique Identifier and Storage
- **Purpose**: Generates unique identifiers and handles storage management.
- **Implementation**:
  - Utilizes UUID for unique identification and manages artifact storage links.
